 .B \-udp
-Enables tunneling over UDP port 53 (DNS) instead of using ICMP. This will only work if your proxy can accept incoming traffic on port 53, and the client is able to send data to the proxy on port 53. Note that this option does not wrap ptunnel's data in DNS-compliant packets. This option must be given on both the proxy and client side for things to work correctly.

 If you find that the proxy isn't working, you will need to enable packet capturing on the main network device. Currently this device is assumed to be an ethernet-device (i.e., ethernet or wireless). Packet capturing is enabled by giving the -c switch, and supplying the device name to capture packets on (for instance eth0 or en1). The same goes for the client. On Mac OS X, packet capturing must always be enabled (both for proxy and client), as resent packets won't be received otherwise.
 
-To protect yourself from others using your proxy, you can protect access to it with a password using the <tt>-x</tt> switch. The password is never sent in the clear, but keep in mind that it may be visible from tools like top or ps, which can display the command line used to start an application.
