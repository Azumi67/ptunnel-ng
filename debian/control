Description: Tunnel TCP connections over ICMP packets
 ptunnel is an application that allows you to reliably tunnel TCP
 connections to a remote host using ICMP echo request and reply
 packets, commonly known as ping requests and replies. It acts as
 a proxy and can handle sockets and secured identification.
 .
 Those features can be very handy when working in a closed networking
 environment with firewalls and proxies.
